Overall Analysis Summary
* Large District schools perform the worst depive having a higher budget per student. This could be driven by having higher class sizes and higher teacher to student ratios than smaller charter schools
* As the budget per student goes up the overall pass rate goes down. This means that getting more money per student doesn't fix the quality of the education
* Medium charter schools with low budget $ per student are the best performing schools
